# Trenditter Classifier
Tweet Classifier to train AI model for classifying tweets! The goal of this project is to have a spam-free [Persian] twitter (it can be applied on any other languages just by changing the data and some modifications with the code, especially the NLP part)!



## How To Contribute

We are gathering some data to train our Classifier so we can label tweets as one of 4 default categories:

* اسپم
* جوک و سرگرمی
* خبری
* سخن تهدید آمیز

Therefore, to gather train data, we have created 4 files named with categories above:

* spam.txt
* entertainment.txt
* news.txt
* hatespeech.txt

If you want to contribute to our project, you have to just send us a pull request, providing us as many tweets classified as you can! Just notice that tweets are separated in each file with a blank line between them, to make you comfort, we have initially provided you with some samples!
